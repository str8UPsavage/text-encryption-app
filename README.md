#Text Encryption App

A simple app I built to understand how basic encryption techniques work. It's made with plain JavaScript (no frameworks) and simulates three classical methods: Caesar Cipher, VigenÃ¨re Cipher, and XOR encryption.

The goal was to explore how encryption and decryption function at a basic level, especially focusing on symmetric key logic, how inputs are handled, and what kind of mistakes could lead to weak encryption.

### Tech stack
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)

### Running it
Just clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser. You can enter any text, pick the encryption method, and see the result instantly. Thereâ€™s no backend â€“ itâ€™s fully frontend-based.

This was part of my cybersecurity learning journey. Nothing advanced or professional â€“ just a way to get hands-on with the basics and understand how simple ciphers behave.
