# Text Encryption App 🔐

This is a frontend-based demo app built with vanilla JavaScript, designed to simulate the functioning of three classical encryption methods:

- Caesar Cipher (numeric shift)
- Vigenère Cipher (keyed substitution)
- XOR Cipher (binary-level encryption)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of a cybersecurity learning path, to experiment with:

- Encryption and decryption principles
- Symmetric key logic
- Input handling and basic cryptanalysis risks

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (no frameworks)
