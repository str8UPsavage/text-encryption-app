# üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations - Text Encryption App

This document outlines the cryptographic weaknesses, potential misuse, and limitations of the algorithms implemented in the **Text Encryption App**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è General Warning

This project is intended **for educational purposes only**. It is not secure for real-world data protection, secure communication, or production use.

---

## üîì Security Limitations of Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Caesar Cipher

- **Type:** Monoalphabetic substitution
- **Key Space:** Very small (only 25 usable shifts)
- **Vulnerability:**
  - Easily broken using brute-force or frequency analysis.
- **Security Level:** ‚ùå Insecure

---

### 2. Vigen√®re Cipher

- **Type:** Polyalphabetic substitution
- **Key Space:** Medium (based on length and content of key)
- **Vulnerability:**
  - Breakable with Kasiski examination or frequency analysis if the key is short or reused.
- **Security Level:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak (only better than Caesar)

---

### 3. XOR Cipher

- **Type:** Symmetric bitwise operation
- **Key Space:** Depends on key length
- **Vulnerability:**
  - If key is reused or predictable, XOR is easily broken.
  - If key is as long as the message and random (One-Time Pad), it is secure‚Äîbut this is not implemented here.
- **Security Level:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium to Low

---

## üö´ Not Implemented

- No secure key exchange (e.g., RSA, Diffie-Hellman)
- No message authentication (MAC, HMAC)
- No hashing or integrity verification
- No randomness or entropy in encryption
- No protection against replay, tampering, or eavesdropping

---

## ‚úÖ Educational Value

Despite its weaknesses, this app helps users:

- Understand symmetric encryption fundamentals
- Visualize how ciphers manipulate characters
- Learn the importance of **key management**
- Compare historical vs. modern cryptography

---

## üîê For Real Security

Use modern, vetted cryptographic libraries and standards such as:

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- RSA with key lengths ‚â•2048 bits
- SHA-256 or SHA-3 for hashing
- TLS for secure communication

**Reminder:** This app is a learning tool, not a secure system. Never use it to protect confidential data.
